        * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Documentation
        * 
        * Introduction:
        * OOP is a programming paradigm that utilizes objects, classes, and various principles to design and structure code.
        * This documentation provides an overview of key OOP concepts.
        * 
        * Key Concepts:
        * 1. **Class:**
        *    - A blueprint for creating objects.
        *    - Defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.
        * 
        * 2. **Object:**
        *    - An instance of a class.
        *    - Represents a real-world entity with characteristics and behaviors defined by its class.
        * 
        * 3. **Encapsulation:**
        *    - The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).
        *    - Access to the internal details is controlled through public, private, and protected access modifiers.
        * 
        * 4. **Inheritance:**
        *    - A mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class).
        *    - Supports code reuse and the creation of specialized classes.
        * 
        * 5. **Polymorphism:**
        *    - The ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
        *    - Achieved through method overloading and method overriding.
        * 
        * 6. **Abstraction:**
        *    - Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors.
        *    - Focuses on what an object does rather than how it achieves it.
        * 
        * Benefits of OOP:
        * - Code Reusability: Classes and objects facilitate reuse of code.
        * - Modularity: Encapsulation allows for modular design and maintenance.
        * - Flexibility and Extensibility: Inheritance and polymorphism support flexible and extensible code.
        * - Understandability: OOP models real-world entities, making code more readable and understandable.
        * 
        * Best Practices:
        * - Follow the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
        * - Use design patterns to solve common problems and promote best practices.
        * - Write clean and modular code to enhance maintainability.
        * 
        * Conclusion:
        * Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful paradigm that enhances code organization, readability, and maintainability.
        * By understanding and applying these key concepts and best practices, developers can create robust and scalable software solutions.
