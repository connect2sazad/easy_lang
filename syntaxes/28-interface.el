        # Note: Easy Language (EL) does not currently support the concept of interfaces.
        #       An interface defines a contract for classes to implement certain methods.
        # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Abstraction in EL:
        #   Abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and abstract methods. Abstract
        #   classes can declare abstract methods that must be implemented by their
        #   derived classes, providing a form of contract.
        # -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        # Future Considerations:
        #   If there is a demand for a more formalized interface concept in Easy Language,
        #   it may be considered for future versions. Currently, the language relies on
        #   abstract classes and method signatures for achieving abstraction and contracts.
